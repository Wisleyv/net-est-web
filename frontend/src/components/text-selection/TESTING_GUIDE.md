/**
 * Text Selection Testing Guide
 * 
 * Changes Made to Fix Selection Issues:
 * 
 * 1. MENU INTERFERENCE WITH SELECTION
 *    - Added mouse down/up tracking to prevent menu during active selection
 *    - Increased debounce delay from 150ms to 200ms
 *    - Added stability delay of 300ms before showing menu
 *    - Added multiple validation checks before menu display
 * 
 * 2. MENU POSITIONING GOING OFF-SCREEN
 *    - Enhanced calculateHierarchicalMenuPosition() with better bounds checking
 *    - Added smart vertical repositioning (above if no space below)
 *    - Added horizontal adjustment for narrow screens
 *    - Increased edge margins from 15px to 20px
 *    - Added responsive width/height adjustment for small screens
 * 
 * 3. SELECTED TEXT TRUNCATION
 *    - Increased preview text length from 50 to 80 characters
 *    - Better text wrapping in menu header
 *    - Improved menu layout for longer text selections
 * 
 * 4. CSS IMPROVEMENTS
 *    - Fixed menu content scrolling (header and footer stay fixed)
 *    - Added proper flex layout with shrink controls
 *    - Added responsive design for narrow viewports
 *    - Enhanced visual feedback and accessibility
 * 
 * Testing Scenarios:
 * 
 * 1. Test text selection at different viewport positions:
 *    - Top edge of screen
 *    - Bottom edge of screen  
 *    - Left edge of screen
 *    - Right edge of screen
 *    - Center of screen
 * 
 * 2. Test with different text lengths:
 *    - Short selections (3-10 chars)
 *    - Medium selections (20-50 chars)
 *    - Long selections (80+ chars)
 * 
 * 3. Test selection behavior:
 *    - Quick selections (release immediately)
 *    - Slow drag selections
 *    - Multi-line selections
 *    - Selections across existing tags
 * 
 * 4. Test menu interactions:
 *    - Scroll through categories when menu is height-constrained
 *    - Click "Cancelar" and "Aplicar" buttons should always be visible
 *    - Search functionality should work
 *    - Categories should expand/collapse properly
 * 
 * Expected Behavior After Fixes:
 * 
 * ✅ Menu should NOT appear during text selection drag
 * ✅ Menu should appear after selection is complete and stable
 * ✅ Menu should always fit within viewport bounds
 * ✅ Action buttons should never be cut off
 * ✅ Longer text selections should display more preview text
 * ✅ Menu should work on different screen sizes
