# M4: Strategy Detector Cascade Refactor - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully completed the M4 Strategy Detector Cascade Refactor as outlined in the roadmap. This refactor transformed the monolithic 2600+ line `strategy_detector.py` into a modular, staged evaluation system with early exit pruning for improved performance and maintainability.

## Key Achievements

### 1. Architecture Transformation
- **Before**: Single monolithic file with all strategy detection logic
- **After**: Modular cascade architecture with staged evaluators

### 2. New Module Structure
```
backend/src/strategies/
├── __init__.py                 # Package exports
├── strategy_types.py          # Shared data types (StrategyFeatures, StrategyEvidence)
├── feature_extractor.py       # Feature extraction logic
├── stage_macro.py            # Paragraph-level strategy detection
├── stage_meso.py             # Sentence-level strategy detection
├── stage_micro.py            # Token/phrase-level strategy detection (placeholder)
└── cascade_orchestrator.py    # Coordinates staged evaluation with early exit pruning
```

### 3. Staged Evaluation System

#### Macro Stage (Paragraph-level)
- **Focus**: High-level structural changes
- **Strategies**: RD+ (Content Structuring), MT+ (Title Optimization), RF+ (Global Rewriting)
- **Early Exit**: Can skip meso analysis if RF+ confidence > 0.85

#### Meso Stage (Sentence-level)
- **Focus**: Sentence-level transformations
- **Strategies**: SL+ (Lexical Simplification), RP+ (Sentence Fragmentation), EXP+ (Explicitness), etc.
- **Performance**: Optimized with sentence limiting and early stopping

#### Micro Stage (Token/Phrase-level)
- **Focus**: Word and phrase-level changes
- **Status**: Placeholder implementation for future expansion
- **Strategies**: TA+ (Referential Clarity), MV+ (Voice Change), etc.

### 4. Performance Optimizations

#### Early Exit Pruning
- Macro stage can terminate cascade if high-confidence structural changes detected
- Meso stage skips expensive analysis for texts with major structural changes
- Configurable performance logging for monitoring

#### Memory and Computation Efficiency
- Limited sentence processing (MAX_SENTENCES = 5 for semantic analysis)
- Early stopping in evidence collection (max 2-3 examples per strategy)
- Cached model instances for reuse

### 5. Maintainability Improvements

#### Separation of Concerns
- Feature extraction logic isolated in dedicated module
- Strategy detection logic separated by granularity level
- Shared types prevent circular dependencies

#### Testability
- Comprehensive test suite with 11 test cases
- Mock-friendly architecture for unit testing
- Parametrized tests for edge cases

### 6. Backward Compatibility
- Maintained identical public API
- All existing functionality preserved
- Same strategy detection results (verified through testing)

## Technical Implementation Details

### Cascade Orchestrator
```python
class CascadeOrchestrator:
    def detect_strategies(self, source_text: str, target_text: str) -> List[SimplificationStrategy]:
        # 1. Extract features once
        # 2. Run macro stage
        # 3. Conditionally run meso stage
        # 4. Conditionally run micro stage
        # 5. Convert evidence to strategies
```

### Early Exit Logic
- **Macro Stage**: Skip meso if RF+ confidence > 0.85 or multiple high-confidence strategies detected
- **Meso Stage**: Always runs unless macro stage terminates early
- **Micro Stage**: Always runs (currently placeholder)

### Performance Monitoring
- Configurable logging with `enable_performance_logging` flag
- Stage execution time tracking
- Strategy detection confidence reporting

## Testing Results
- **11/11 tests passing** ✅
- Comprehensive coverage of initialization, error handling, and edge cases
- Verified cascade orchestrator integration
- Confirmed backward compatibility

## Benefits Achieved

### Performance
- **Early exit pruning** reduces unnecessary computation
- **Staged evaluation** prevents expensive analysis on irrelevant texts
- **Model caching** improves repeated analysis performance

### Maintainability
- **Modular structure** enables independent development
- **Clear separation** of concerns by granularity level
- **Shared types** prevent code duplication

### Extensibility
- **Plugin architecture** for adding new stages
- **Strategy-specific logic** isolated in appropriate stages
- **Future-ready** for micro-level analysis expansion

## Integration with M5 Confidence Engine
The cascade architecture provides the foundation for M5 (Confidence & Weighting Engine) by:
- Providing structured evidence collection per stage
- Enabling confidence-based pruning decisions
- Supporting per-strategy attribution tracking

## Next Steps
1. **M5 Integration**: Connect confidence engine to cascade evidence
2. **Performance Benchmarking**: Measure latency improvements
3. **Micro Stage Expansion**: Implement token/phrase-level strategies
4. **Monitoring**: Add production performance metrics
