# Key Problems to Address:

1. **Integration Instability** - New changes break existing functionality
2. **Testing Overhead** - Current testing approach is too disruptive
3. **Risk Management** - Lack of safeguards against regression
4. **Resource Efficiency** - Need to minimize time/money waste

### Revised Implementation Strategy:

1. **Isolated Feature Development**  
   
   - Develop new features in separate branches with strict abstraction boundaries
   - Use feature flags to toggle new functionality without affecting existing systems

2. **Robust Testing Pipeline**  
   
   - Implement comprehensive snapshot testing to detect regressions
   - Create automated integration tests that run before deployment

3. **Staged Rollout Approach**  
   
   - Use canary deployments to test new features with a subset of traffic
   - Implement automatic rollback mechanisms

4. **Enhanced Observability**  
   
   - Add detailed logging and monitoring to quickly identify failure points
   - Create automated alerts for performance degradation

### Proposed Action Plan:

1. First establish safety nets to prevent regression
2. Then implement features in smaller, isolated increments
3. Validate each step with automated checks before integration

### Updated Todo List Prioritizing Stability:

- Implement snapshot testing for core functionality
- Set up feature flag system for experimental features
- Create automated regression test suite
- Develop isolation layer for sentence alignment service
- Implement canary deployment configuration
- Add performance monitoring hooks
- Integrate spaCy with fallback mechanism
- Develop similarity matrix algorithm
- Create phased rollout plan for M1

The stability-focused implementation plan has been updated successfully. This revised approach prioritizes:

1. **Safety Nets First**: Establishing testing frameworks and feature flags before feature development
2. **Isolation**: Developing the sentence alignment service with clear boundaries
3. **Observability**: Adding monitoring to quickly detect issues
4. **Controlled Rollout**: Implementing canary deployment for risk mitigation

This directly addresses the user's concerns about:

- Disruptions to working functionality
- Wasted time/resources from regressions
- Ineffective modular implementation

# Safeguards Still Needed (22/08/2025)

- Full implementation of snapshot testing for all core functionality

- Complete automated regression test suite

- Isolation layer for sentence alignment service (if not yet done)

- Canary deployment configuration and rollback automation

- Performance monitoring hooks and alerting

- spaCy fallback mechanism
  

**Most Logical Next Step***


Establish and validate the safety nets before further feature development.
This means:

    Implement snapshot testing for all core modules.
    Set up feature flag system for experimental features.
    Create and run automated regression tests.
