# Phase 2.B.5 - Dual Input Architecture Implementation

## Date: August 3, 2025
## Status: CRITICAL STRUCTURAL REQUIREMENT IDENTIFIED

## Problem Statement

The current NET implementation only supports single text input and processing, but the project's core objective is to **compare source texts with their simplified translations** to identify simplification strategies used by translators.

## Current Architecture Gap

### What We Have:
- Single text input (TextInputFieldIntegrated)
- Single text processing (semantic alignment)
- Single output (simplified text generation)

### What We Need:
- **Dual text input system**
- **Comparative analysis engine**
- **Simplification strategy identification**

## Proposed Implementation Plan

### 1. Enhanced Input Interface

#### A. Dual Text Input Component
```jsx
// DualTextInputComponent.jsx
- Source Text Input (original complex text)
- Target Text Input (simplified translation)
- Validation to ensure both texts are provided
- File upload support for both texts
```

#### B. Enhanced Backend API
```python
# New endpoint: /api/v1/comparative-analysis
- Accept source_text and target_text
- Perform comparative analysis
- Identify simplification strategies
- Return detailed analysis results
```

### 2. Comparative Analysis Engine

#### A. Text Comparison Algorithms
- **Lexical Analysis**: Vocabulary complexity comparison
- **Syntactic Analysis**: Sentence structure simplification
- **Semantic Analysis**: Meaning preservation verification
- **Readability Metrics**: Before/after readability scores

#### B. Strategy Identification
- **Lexical Substitution**: Complex → simple word replacements
- **Syntactic Simplification**: Long → short sentences
- **Content Reduction**: Information removal/condensation
- **Structural Reorganization**: Text structure changes

### 3. Enhanced Results Display

#### A. Comparative Results Interface
- Side-by-side text comparison
- Highlighted differences
- Strategy identification markers
- Quantitative analysis metrics

#### B. Analysis Reports
- Simplification strategy summary
- Readability improvement metrics
- Detailed linguistic analysis
- Export capabilities

## Implementation Priority

**HIGH PRIORITY**: This addresses the core project objective and should be implemented before comprehensive testing.

## Next Steps

1. **Pause Phase 2.B.4 testing** of current single-text system
2. **Implement Phase 2.B.5** dual input architecture
3. **Resume comprehensive testing** with proper dual-input functionality

## Impact on Current Work

- Phase 2.B.3 components can be adapted/extended
- ErrorBoundary and notification systems remain valid
- React Query hooks need extension for comparative analysis
- Backend services need new comparative analysis endpoints

---

**Recommendation**: Implement Phase 2.B.5 before proceeding with systematic testing to ensure we're testing the correct, complete functionality that aligns with the project's core objectives.
