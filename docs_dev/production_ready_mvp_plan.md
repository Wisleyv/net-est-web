# Production-Ready MVP Implementation Plan
**Date:** September 20, 2025  
**Priority:** Immediate production-readiness for stable release  
**Scope:** Minimum viable fixes only - NO scope creep

## CONFIRMED UNDERSTANDING

✅ **Primary Goal:** Deliver production-ready MVP with stable inline tag editing  
✅ **Critical Path:** Fix inline editing FIRST (blocking production release)  
✅ **No Scope Creep:** Strictly limited to Phase 1 & 2 of inline editing, essential segmentation fixes only  
✅ **Atomic Commits:** Each discrete fix = separate commit with evidence-based validation  
✅ **No Complex Features:** Absolutely NO reintroduction of accessibility toggles, patterns, or unstable features

## PRODUCTION-READY DEFINITION FOR INLINE EDITING

User must be able to:
1. ✅ Reliably select text (multi-word, duplicate phrases) in Target Text
2. ✅ Open context menu and add new tag without errors  
3. ✅ Click existing tags (system + user-added) to edit/delete via context menu
4. ✅ Perform actions without frontend crashes, console errors, or wrong position mapping

## REVISED WEEK-BY-WEEK PLAN

### **Week 1 (Sep 20-26): PRIORITY 1 - Core Inline Editing Fixes**

#### **Day 1-2: Position Calculation Fix (Critical)**
- **Task:** Replace `indexOf()` with DOM-based position mapping
- **Files:** `ComparativeResultsDisplay.jsx` (handleTextSelection function)
- **Commit:** "fix: replace indexOf with DOM-based position mapping for selections"
- **Validation:** Test duplicate text selection, multi-word selection, boundary cases

#### **Day 3-4: Selection Management Enhancement**  
- **Task:** Add selection validation, cross-browser normalization
- **Files:** `ComparativeResultsDisplay.jsx` (handleContextMenu, selection handling)
- **Commit:** "fix: enhance selection validation and cross-browser compatibility"
- **Validation:** Test context menu positioning, selection persistence

#### **Day 5: Integration Testing & Bug Fixes**
- **Task:** End-to-end testing of inline editing workflow
- **Validation:** Complete production-ready criteria verification
- **Deliverable:** Stable inline editing ready for user testing

### **Week 2 (Sep 27-Oct 3): PRIORITY 2 - Essential Segmentation Fixes**

#### **Day 1-2: Core Overlap Resolution**
- **Task:** Fix overlapping span rendering without complex merging
- **Files:** `unifiedStrategyMapping.js` (segmentTextForHighlights, mergeOverlappingSegments)
- **Commit:** "fix: simplify segment overlap resolution to prevent visual artifacts"
- **Validation:** Test overlapping strategy highlights, text alignment

#### **Day 3: Minimum Color Contrast**
- **Task:** Ensure readable color combinations only
- **Files:** `strategyColorMapping.js` (color values adjustment)
- **Commit:** "fix: adjust color opacity for minimum contrast compliance"
- **Validation:** Manual contrast testing, readability verification

#### **Day 4-5: Stabilization & Documentation**
- **Task:** Final testing, bug fixes, document detection accuracy plan
- **Deliverable:** Production-ready MVP with stable highlighting

## STRICT IMPLEMENTATION PROTOCOL

### **Atomic Commit Strategy:**
- Each fix = separate commit with descriptive message
- Immediate push to remote after successful local testing
- No bundling of unrelated changes

### **Evidence-Based Validation:**
Before marking any task complete, provide:
1. **Exact steps** for frontend verification at `http://localhost:5173`
2. **Expected behavior** vs **actual behavior** 
3. **Console log verification** (no errors)
4. **Cross-browser testing** (Chrome, Firefox minimum)

### **Forbidden Activities:**
- ❌ Working on detection accuracy improvements
- ❌ Reintroducing accessibility toggles or complex patterns  
- ❌ UI/UX enhancements beyond functional fixes
- ❌ Performance optimizations not directly related to stability
- ❌ Any feature additions not explicitly listed in scope

## SUCCESS METRICS

**Week 1 Success:** User can reliably add/edit/delete tags without position errors  
**Week 2 Success:** Highlighting system is visually stable with readable colors  
**MVP Success:** Application is ready for production deployment

## POST-MVP DEFERRED ITEMS

1. Strategy Detection Accuracy Improvements (Weeks 4-8)
2. Advanced annotation store reliability features
3. User experience enhancements (undo/redo, keyboard shortcuts)
4. Comprehensive accessibility features
5. Performance optimizations beyond stability

**COMMITMENT CONFIRMED:** I will strictly adhere to this plan, focusing exclusively on production-readiness with no scope creep. Each commit will be atomic with evidence-based validation before proceeding.
