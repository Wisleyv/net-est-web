### **AI Agent Development Guidelines**

Please adhere to the following principles for all tasks:

- **Cleanliness:** Make minimal, targeted changes. Remove debug logs and comments before finalizing. Follow existing code patterns and style.

- **Documentation:** Update relevant documentation (e.g., `ONBOARDING.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`) concurrently with code changes. Explain the "why" for non-trivial logic in comments.

- **Organization:** Reuse existing patterns and utilities. Ensure new code integrates seamlessly with the current architecture (e.g., repository abstraction, state management).

- **Communication:** Provide a concise summary upon completion, including what was changed, test results, and any specific verification steps.

- **Production-Readiness:** Prioritize stability and user experience. Implement robust error handling and ensure all changes are covered by tests to prevent regressions.
