# Clean Environment Restart Procedure

## Date: August 3, 2025
## Purpose: Clean restart after VS Code configuration changes

### Current State Before Cleanup:
- Multiple Python processes running (PIDs: 4836, 15524, 22312, 22336, 28332, 35160, 37712, 49112)
- Multiple Copilot terminal instances accumulated
- Failed command attempts in terminals
- New VS Code configuration applied but not effective due to existing processes

### Cleanup Results:
- **Attempted Python process cleanup:** Some processes terminated, others persist (system/protected processes)
- **Remaining Python PIDs:** 6836, 9684, 20116, 30340, 31736, 37736, 37840, 38704
- **Recommendation:** Complete VS Code restart required for full cleanup

### Cleanup Steps:

1. **Kill all Python/Uvicorn processes:**
   ```powershell
   Get-Process | Where-Object {$_.ProcessName -like "*python*" -or $_.ProcessName -like "*uvicorn*"} | Stop-Process -Force
   ```

2. **Close all VS Code terminals:**
   - Use Ctrl+Shift+P → "Terminal: Kill All Terminals"
   - Or manually close each terminal tab

3. **Restart VS Code completely:**
   - File → Exit (or Ctrl+Shift+F4)
   - Reopen VS Code
   - Open the NET workspace

4. **Verify clean environment:**
   - Check that new terminal starts in correct directory (should be C:\net due to updated settings)
   - Navigate to backend folder
   - Activate virtual environment
   - Test Python execution

### Expected Results After Cleanup:
- Single terminal instance
- Correct working directory behavior
- Clean Python process environment
- VS Code configuration changes take effect

### Post-Cleanup Testing Checklist:
- [ ] New terminal opens in C:\net (workspace root)
- [ ] Can navigate to backend successfully
- [ ] Virtual environment activation works properly
- [ ] Python commands execute from correct directory
- [ ] No lingering background processes

**Next Step:** Execute cleanup and test fresh environment with corrected VS Code configuration.
