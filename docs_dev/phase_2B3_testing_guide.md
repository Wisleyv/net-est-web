# Senior Systems Analyst Review: Phase 2.B.3 Alignment & Testing Guide

---

## 1. Project Alignment Analysis

**Main Goal:**  
The NET project aims to deliver a robust, modular, and user-friendly system for textual simplification and semantic alignment, with centralized error handling, clear user feedback, and seamless frontend-backend integration.

**Current Structure (as of Phase 2.B.3):**
- **Frontend:** Modular React components, Zustand for global state, React Query for async state, centralized error handling (`ErrorBoundary`, `useErrorHandler`), and notification system.
- **Backend Integration:** API service layer with endpoints for text processing and semantic alignment.
- **Error Handling:** All components wrapped with `ErrorBoundary`, unified notification center, and contextual error messages.
- **User Feedback:** Real-time loading indicators, toast notifications, and fallback UIs.
- **Modularity:** Each feature (input, alignment, results) is encapsulated and independent.

**Conclusion:**  
The implementation is fully aligned with the project’s main goal. The architecture supports reliability, maintainability, and a professional user experience.

## 2. Step-by-Step Guide: Testing Newly Implemented Functionalities

### A. Environment Preparation
1. Ensure all dependencies are installed (`npm install` or `yarn`).
2. Start the backend server and confirm API endpoints are reachable.
3. Start the frontend (`npm run dev` or equivalent).

---

### B. Functional Testing Steps

**1. Error Handling & Feedback**
- Deliberately introduce a JavaScript error in a child component.
- Confirm that the `ErrorBoundary` displays the fallback UI and offers reset/home options.
- In development mode, check that error details are shown.
- Simulate API failures (e.g., disconnect backend) and verify error notifications appear.

**2. Text Input Processing**
- Enter text manually and submit.
- Upload supported file types (`.txt`, `.md`, `.docx`, `.odt`, `.pdf`).
- Try uploading an unsupported file type and a file >10MB; confirm warning notifications.
- Check that loading indicators and success notifications appear.

**3. Semantic Alignment**
- After text input, select different education levels and process alignment.
- Toggle advanced options and verify they affect the request.
- Confirm that alignment results are displayed, with statistics and explanations.

**4. Results Display**
- View processed text, compare original vs. aligned, and check explanations.
- Use copy, download, and share actions; verify clipboard and file download.
- Edit the aligned text and save; confirm feedback and state update.

**5. Notification System**
- Trigger success, error, warning, and info notifications via various actions.
- Confirm notifications auto-dismiss and display correct icons/messages.

**6. State Management**
- Reset analysis and confirm all states clear.
- Check that online/offline status updates correctly when toggling network.

**7. API Integration**
- Monitor network requests in browser dev tools; confirm correct endpoints and payloads.
- Validate caching and retry behavior of React Query.

### C. Edge Case & Regression Testing
- Rapidly switch tabs and submit multiple requests; check for race conditions.
- Test on mobile and desktop for responsive layout.
- Try browser refresh and navigation; confirm state persistence or reset as designed.

---

### D. Automated Testing (Recommended Next Steps)
- Write unit tests for hooks and components (Jest/React Testing Library).
- Implement integration tests for API endpoints.
- Add e2e tests for user flows (Cypress/Playwright).

---

### E. Documentation & Reporting
- Document any issues found and steps to reproduce.
- Update the implementation summary with test results and recommendations.

---

**Summary:**  
The current implementation is robust and matches the project’s goals. Follow the above guide to systematically validate all new functionalities and ensure production readiness.
