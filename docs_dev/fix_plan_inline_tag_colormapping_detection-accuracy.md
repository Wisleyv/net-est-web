**FOLLOW-UP GUIDELINES FOR ADJUSTING THE FIX PLAN BY CLAUDE**

I understand and fully accept the reprioritized directive for immediate production-readiness. You're absolutely right that the focus must be on delivering a stable MVP rather than comprehensive optimizations.

COMMITMENT CONFIRMED

I fully understand and accept the reprioritized directive. My revised plan strictly focuses on:

IMMEDIATE PRIORITIES (Production-Blocking):
    'Priority 1: Inline Tag Editing Fixes (Week 1)
Scope: ONLY Phase 1 (Position Calculation) & Phase 2 (Selection Management)
Goal: Meet the 4-point production-ready definition you outlined
NO scope creep: Absolutely no work on annotation store enhancements or UX improvements
    Priority 2: Essential Segmentation Stabilization (Week 2)
Scope: ONLY core overlap resolution and minimum contrast fixes
Critical Constraint: NO reintroduction of accessibility toggles, patterns, or complex features
Goal: Stable, readable highlighting without visual artifacts
Deferred (Post-MVP): Strategy Detection Accuracy - documented for future implementation
STRICT IMPLEMENTATION PROTOCOL ACCEPTED:
✅ Atomic commits with clear messages
✅ Immediate pushes after successful testing
✅ Evidence-based validation with precise verification steps
✅ No forbidden activities (no detection work, no complex accessibility features)

I'm ready to begin with Priority 1, Day 1-2: Position Calculation Fix. Should I start by examining the current handleTextSelection function in ComparativeResultsDisplay.jsx to implement the DOM-based position mapping replacement for indexOf()?
