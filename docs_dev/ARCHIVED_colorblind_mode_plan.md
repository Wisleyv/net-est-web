# ARCHIVED: Colorblind Mode Feature Plan

**Status**: REMOVED (2025-09-20)
**Reason**: Rendering instability with overlapping spans and poor color contrast

## Overview

The "Modo Acessível" (Accessible Mode) feature was designed to provide high-contrast colors and patterns for users with color vision deficiencies. However, it was removed due to fundamental rendering issues that made the source text unreadable.

## Components Removed

### 1. UI Components
- **Toggle Button**: "Modo Acessível" button in the header with Eye icon
- **State Management**: `colorblindMode` useState variable and setter
- **Conditional Styling**: All `colorblindMode ? A : B` logic replaced with default (false) path

### 2. Visual Features
- **High Contrast Colors**: Colorblind-friendly color palette
- **Pattern Overlays**: Diagonal stripes, dots, and other patterns for overlapping segments
- **Background Modifications**: White backgrounds for better contrast
- **Text Color Adjustments**: Darker text colors for readability

### 3. Technical Implementation
- **Strategy Color Mapping**: `getStrategyColor(code, colorblindMode)` calls
- **Pattern Generation**: `getStrategyPattern()` function usage
- **CSS Generation**: `generateStrategyCSSClasses(colorblindMode)` calls
- **Component Props**: `useColorblindFriendly` prop passed to child components

## Issues That Led to Removal

### 1. Overlapping Span Rendering
- **Problem**: When multiple strategies overlapped, the diagonal stripe patterns created visual noise
- **Impact**: Text became unreadable due to competing visual elements
- **Attempted Fix**: `mergeOverlappingSegments()` function failed to scale beyond simple test cases

### 2. Color Contrast Problems
- **Problem**: High-contrast colors on white backgrounds caused poor readability
- **Impact**: Source text was difficult to read in colorblind mode
- **Root Cause**: Aggressive color palette didn't account for text legibility

### 3. Maintenance Complexity
- **Problem**: Feature required extensive conditional logic throughout the codebase
- **Impact**: Made the code harder to maintain and debug
- **Decision**: Remove feature entirely rather than attempt complex fixes

## Current State (Post-Removal)

### ✅ Preserved Functionality
- All core annotation features work exactly as before
- Text highlighting and selection functionality intact
- Strategy detection and display unchanged
- Export and import capabilities preserved

### ✅ Default Styling Applied
- Application uses standard color palette permanently
- No toggle button or mode switching
- Consistent visual experience for all users
- Simplified codebase with fewer conditional branches

## Migration Notes

### For Users
- The "Modo Acessível" button is no longer available
- Application now uses default styling permanently
- All accessibility features (keyboard navigation, screen reader support) remain intact
- Text remains readable with standard contrast ratios

### For Developers
- Removed `colorblindMode` state variable and all related logic
- Cleaned up orphaned imports (`getStrategyPattern`, `HighContrastPatternLegend`)
- Simplified conditional logic throughout the component
- Updated documentation to reflect the change

## Future Considerations

If colorblind accessibility is needed in the future, consider:
1. **WCAG Compliant Colors**: Use officially tested color combinations
2. **Pattern-Free Approach**: Avoid complex pattern overlays that interfere with text
3. **Separate Component**: Implement as a standalone accessibility layer rather than a toggle
4. **User Preferences**: Store accessibility preferences in user settings rather than component state
