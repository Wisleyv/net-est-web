# Phase 2.B.4 Testing Session

## Date: August 3, 2025
## Status: IN PROGRESS

## Environment Setup âœ… COMPLETED

### Backend Server
- **Status**: âœ… RUNNING via VS Code Task (Directory Jumping Issue RESOLVED)
- **URL**: http://127.0.0.1:8000
- **Documentation**: http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs
- **Method**: VS Code Task "Start Backend Server" with absolute paths and explicit cwd
- **Dependencies**: âœ… All requirements.txt installed (including psutil, numpy, etc.)

### Frontend Development Server  
- **Status**: âœ… RUNNING via VS Code Task  
- **URL**: http://localhost:3000 (Vite automatically selected port 3000)
- **Method**: VS Code Task "Start Frontend Dev Server" with explicit cwd
- **Dependencies**: âœ… npm install completed successfully + react-hot-toast added

### Both Services Verified âœ… SUCCESS
- âœ… Backend API documentation accessible at http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs
- âœ… Frontend application loading at http://localhost:3000 with Phase 2.B.3 components
- âœ… **Directory Jumping Issue RESOLVED** using VS Code Tasks approach
- âœ… All dependencies installed and working (including react-hot-toast)
- âœ… Ready for comprehensive Phase 2.B.4 testing

**Key Achievement**: Successfully implemented the VS Code Tasks solution from `directory_jumping_final_analysis.md`, eliminating the directory jumping issue entirely.

## Phase 2.B.4 Testing Checklist

### A. Environment Preparation âœ… COMPLETED
- [x] Dependencies installed and verified
- [x] Backend server running (VS Code Task method)
- [x] Frontend development server running
- [x] Both services accessible via browser

### B. Functional Testing Steps

#### 1. Error Handling & Feedback ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS
- [x] **Environment Setup**: Added ErrorTestComponent to AppIntegrated for systematic testing
- [x] **Application loaded**: Confirmed integrated app running with Phase 2.B.3 components
- [ ] **ErrorBoundary Test**: Click "ðŸ’¥ Trigger Error" button to test error boundary
- [ ] **Fallback UI Test**: Verify ErrorBoundary displays proper fallback UI with reset options
- [ ] **Development Mode**: Check error details shown in development mode  
- [ ] **API Failure Test**: Simulate API failures (disconnect backend) and verify error notifications
- [ ] **Error Recovery**: Test error recovery mechanisms and user guidance

#### 2. Text Input Processing
- [ ] Enter text manually and submit
- [ ] Upload supported file types (.txt, .md, .docx, .odt, .pdf)
- [ ] Try unsupported file type and >10MB file
- [ ] Verify loading indicators and success notifications

#### 3. Semantic Alignment
- [ ] Select different education levels and process alignment
- [ ] Toggle advanced options and verify request changes
- [ ] Confirm alignment results display with statistics

#### 4. Results Display

## Testing Notes

**Environment Solution**: Successfully resolved directory jumping issue by using VS Code Tasks instead of direct terminal commands. This provides reliable, reproducible execution context.

**Next Action**: Begin systematic functional testing starting with Error Handling & Feedback components.
