Phase 1 Micro-Task Implementation Log

Files added for Micro-Task 1 & 2 validation (frontend):
- `frontend/src/services/textNormalizer.js` : normalization + SHA-256 hash helper (ESM)
- `frontend/src/services/perfInstrumentation.js` : performance measurement helpers (ESM)
- `frontend/tests/textNormalizer.test.js` : vitest-compatible unit tests (ESM)
- `frontend/tests/perfInstrumentation.test.js` : vitest-compatible unit tests (ESM)
- `frontend/tests/run_text_normalizer_runner.js` : ad-hoc Node ESM runner used to validate packages locally

All tests passed in ad-hoc runner. Vitest local run reported unrelated test failures due to backend not running; therefore focused unit tests were validated with the ad-hoc runner.

Next steps: integrate these services into `ComparativeResultsDisplay.jsx` under the strict protocol after you approve. No integration has been done yet.
