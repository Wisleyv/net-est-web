Stabilize dev environment: restore backend, start frontend, E2E smoke test

- Restored backend and resolved missing dependency (spacy); cleaned temp files and stale processes.
- Started frontend dev server and ran smoke E2E comparative-analysis to verify end-to-end connectivity.
- Added diagnostics and helper scripts under `scripts/` for reproducible dev ops.
- Updated documentation: `MAINTENANCE_LOG.md`, onboarding and session notes. Updated CHANGELOG.
- Updated frontend config/deps where needed (package.json, .env.development).

This commit captures the stabilization milestone and artifacts required for team reproduction.
