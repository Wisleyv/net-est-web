# Documentation Consolidation Plan

This document outlines the documentation consolidation plan for the NET-EST project, identifying which files are now obsolete due to the new centralized documentation structure.

## Newly Created Centralized Documentation

The following files now serve as the centralized documentation for the project:

1. **[DOCUMENTATION.md](./DOCUMENTATION.md)** - Central documentation hub with links to all documentation
2. **[ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md)** - Comprehensive system architecture documentation
3. **[DEVELOPMENT.md](./DEVELOPMENT.md)** - Complete development guide and workflow
4. **[DEVELOPMENT_RESOURCES.md](./DEVELOPMENT_RESOURCES.md)** - Consolidated development resources and troubleshooting guides

## Updated README Files

The following README files have been updated to align with the new documentation structure:

1. **[README.md](./README.md)** - Project overview and quick start guide
2. **[backend/README.md](./backend/README.md)** - Backend-specific quick start guide
3. **[frontend/README.md](./frontend/README.md)** - Frontend-specific quick start guide

## Files to Archive (Root)

The following files in the root directory contain information that has been consolidated and should be archived:

1. **`SETUP.md`** - Setup instructions now in DEVELOPMENT.md

## Files to Archive (docs/)

The following files in the `docs/` directory contain information that has been consolidated and should be archived:

1. **`analise_completude_fase1.md`** - Initial project analysis, now consolidated
2. **`componente_autoria_frontend.md`** - Frontend component documentation, now in ARCHITECTURE.md
3. **`fase1_implementacao_tecnica.md`** - Implementation details, now in ARCHITECTURE.md and DEVELOPMENT.md
4. **`intervencao_2.1.1_foundation_layer.md`** - Foundation layer details, now in ARCHITECTURE.md
5. **`modulo1_subdivisao_estrategica.md`** - Module breakdown, now in ARCHITECTURE.md
6. **`plano_desenvolvimento_NET.md`** - Development plan, now in DOCUMENTATION.md and DEVELOPMENT.md
7. **`proposta_arquitetura_algoritmo.md`** - Architecture proposal, now in ARCHITECTURE.md
8. **`STATUS_FOUNDATION_LAYER.md`** - Status information, now in DOCUMENTATION.md

## Files to Keep (docs/)

The following files in the `docs/` directory contain unique information that should be preserved:

1. **`AUTORIA_E_CREDITOS.md`** - Detailed authorship information
2. **`Tabela Simplificação Textual.md`** - Linguistic strategies reference
3. **`api/endpoints.md`** - Detailed API documentation

## Files to Archive (docs_dev/)

The following files in the `docs_dev/` directory contain information that has been consolidated and should be archived:

1. **Project status and session reports** - Historical project status reports
2. **Outdated implementation plans** - Plans that have been completed or superseded
3. **Resolved issue documentation** - Documentation for issues that have been resolved

These files should be moved to `docs_dev/archived/` and referenced in the DEVELOPMENT_RESOURCES.md file as needed.

Key files to keep:
1. **`backend_windows_troubleshooting.md`** - Current troubleshooting guide
2. **`project_structure.md`** - Current project structure documentation
3. **`corrections_applied.md`** - Record of applied corrections

## Archive Process

For each file to be archived:

1. Create a compressed archive in `docs/archived/` or `docs_dev/archived/`
2. Include the file with a note about when it was archived and where its information can now be found
3. Remove the original file once it's safely archived

## Next Steps

1. ✅ **Consolidate Root Documentation**: Create centralized documentation files and archive obsolete files
2. ✅ **Consolidate Backend Documentation**: Backend documentation has been consolidated in the backend/README.md file
3. ✅ **Consolidate Frontend Documentation**: Frontend documentation has been consolidated in the frontend/README.md file
4. ✅ **Consolidate Development Resources**: Development resources have been consolidated in DEVELOPMENT_RESOURCES.md
5. **Maintain Documentation**: Regularly update documentation to reflect project changes

## Completed Steps

1. ✅ Created centralized documentation files (DOCUMENTATION.md, ARCHITECTURE.md, DEVELOPMENT.md, DEVELOPMENT_RESOURCES.md)
2. ✅ Updated README files in the root, backend, and frontend directories
3. ✅ Created archive directories in the root, docs, and docs_dev folders
4. ✅ Archived obsolete files from the root and docs folders
5. ✅ Updated cross-references between documentation files
